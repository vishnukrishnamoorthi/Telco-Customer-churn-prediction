##  Project Description

**Objective**: Predict whether a customer will churn (leave the service) based on historical data.

**Dataset**: Telco Customer Churn dataset  
Source: Provided during internship

**Target Variable**: `Churn` (Yes/No)

## Completed Tasks

### Task 1: Data Loading and Exploration
- Loaded and displayed dataset
- Performed initial EDA (shape, info, null values)

### Task 2: Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values
- Label Encoding & One-Hot Encoding
- Normalized numerical features

### Task 3: Feature Selection
- Correlation analysis
- Selected relevant features using `SelectKBest`

### Task 4: Model Selection
- Compared Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
- Selected the best algorithm based on dataset suitability

### Task 5: Model Training
- Trained the model using selected features and target variable
- Used `train_test_split` for splitting

### Task 6: Model Evaluation
- Evaluated using:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1 Score
  - ROC-AUC Score
- Displayed confusion matrix and ROC Curve
