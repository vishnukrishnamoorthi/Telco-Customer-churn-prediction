Saiket Systems - Machine Learning Internship
Intern: Vishnu K
Domain: Machine Learning
Duration: 1 month

Project Title: Customer Churn Prediction

Description:
This project aims to build a binary classification model to predict customer churn using a real-world telecom dataset. The process includes data preprocessing, feature selection, model building, training, and evaluation.

Tasks Completed:

1. Task 1: Data Preprocessing
   - Loaded dataset
   - Cleaned missing values
   - Label encoded categorical features

2. Task 2: Feature Selection
   - Identified key features influencing churn
   - Used correlation and domain understanding

3. Task 3: Data Splitting
   - Split data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets

4. Task 4: Model Selection
   - Chose Random Forest Classifier for better performance

5. Task 5: Model Training
   - Trained model using selected features

6. Task 6: Model Evaluation
   - Evaluated using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC
